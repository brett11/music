  <!--Here Rails infers that @albums is a list of album objects; moreover, when called with a collection of albums,
  Rails automatically iterates through them and renders each one with the _album.html.erb partial (inferring
  the name of the partial from the name of the class). Basically as if the code has a album.each do loop -->
